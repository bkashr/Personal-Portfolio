                            I'm Ryan, and I've always enjoyed finding patterns in things. Whether it was sports stats, video games, or music, 
                            I liked digging a little deeper to see how and why things worked the way they did. Over time,
                            that curiosity turned into a genuine interest in data and using it to make everyday decisions easier. For me, data is useful
                            because it connects to real experiences, it can help answer questions, point out trends, or just give a clearer view of something you care about.
                            That's what I try to capture in my projects, whether it's analyzing fantasy football drafts, training a chess bot, experimenting with music discovery, 
                            or building my own productivity app. I like starting with an idea and seeing how far I can push it into something real.

                            Outside of projects, I’m usually checking out new apps, experimenting with AI tools, or diving into whatever hobby has my attention at the time. 
                            I see data and tech as a way to explore ideas, stay curious, and build things that actually feel useful.

                            Developed a comprehensive sports betting analysis system focused on NHL "goal scored in 5/10 minutes" markets. 
                            After identifying potential opportunities in FanDuel's niche betting options, I systematically collected data 
                            across 32 games tracking team matchups, over/under odds, goal timing statistics, and betting outcomes. 
                            This data-driven approach led to the creation of a martingale algorithm that simulates betting strategies 
                            across thousands of iterations to evaluate profitability potential.

                                    This project represents my deep dive into game theory, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. 
                                    I'm implementing classical chess programming techniques while exploring modern approaches like 
                                    neural networks for position evaluation. The challenge lies in balancing computational efficiency
